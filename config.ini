CONTENT_ABOUT_US = """### Problem Statement 
  The current process of reviewing lengthy tender documentations is time - consuming and prone to human error, especially in identifying conflicting clauses. 
  This manual review process can lead to delays and potential legal issues if conflicting clauses are not identified and resolved accurately.\n### Proposed Solution 
  Implementing LLM technology to assist in the review of tender documentations can significantly reduce the time and effort required to identify conflicting clauses. 
  By leveraging LLM's natural language processing capabilities, the system can efficiently analyse the various clauses and sub - clauses to flag potential conflicts, 
  thereby streamlining the review process and minimising the risk of oversight.\n### Impact 
  Integrating LLM into the tender documentation review process will lead to improved efficiency and accuracy. 
  This will result in faster turnaround times for tender reviews, reduced potential for legal disputes due to conflicting clauses, and overall cost savings for the organisation. 
  Additionally, the use of LLM technology demonstrates a commitment to leveraging innovative solutions for enhancing operational processes within the organisation.\n### Data Sources
  Documents in DOCX, PDF and TXT format are accepted. As this Solution allows one to create *Repository* of documents freely, data source(s) can be prepared separately.\n
  However, feel free to download sample documents prepared by us from below:  
  1) [SectionA.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lohhonch/honchun-abc/2d8bf8312caf8bb796564baeef52ca7e634629da/sample/SectionA.pdf)

CONTENT_METHODOLOGY = """### 1. Use case: Analyse conflicts within each document in selected repository \n 
  As illustrated in bubble ***3a***, this use case verifies whether there are conflicting clauses within individual documents in the repository. 
  Users may choose to analyse a single document or all documents in the repository.\n
  Additional screenshots are available in the Presentation Deck included in the project submission.\n### 2. Use case: Submit a clause to check for conflicts against documents in the selected repository \n
  As illustrated in bubble ***3b***, this use case enables users to submit clauses to the application, which then checks whether these submitted clauses conflict with any clauses in each document within the repository.\n
  Additional screenshots are available in the Presentation Deck included in the project submission. """
